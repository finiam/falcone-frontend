## Calls

### Buying a Call (Long Call)

Calls are typically used when you anticipate an asset will appreciate, allowing you to profit from the price difference. A good mental model to understand it is that of placing a bet that the price of the asset will rise. By purchasing a call option, you can potentially profit from the upward movement of the asset's price, without actually owning the asset itself.

    If the price of Ethereum exceeds the strike price, you can exercise the call
    option and buy Ethereum at the strike price. <a href='/liquidity-pools'>You may then immediately sell
    it in the free market at the higher market price.</a> Your profit would be the
    difference between the market price and the strike price, minus the premium
    paid for the call option.

  <ConceptsBox title="Loss" color="red">
    If the price of Ethereum does not rise above the strike price before the
    option's expiration, the call option may expire worthless, resulting in a
    loss limited to the premium paid for the option.

###### Example

You believe that the price of Ethereum, currently trading at $2,800, will increase in the near future, so you go Long on a Call.

You decide to buy a call option on Ethereum with a strike price of $3,000 and an expiration date of one month. The premium for the call option is $100.

    <ConceptsExample 
        type="In-the-money" 
        header="Price of ethereum goes up to $3500" >
        You can exercise the Call option and buy the stock at the lower strike price, potentially making a profit.

        - Current Price: $3500
        - Strike Price: $3,000
        - Premium paid: $100

        **Total Profit: $400 ($3,500 - $3,000 - $100)**
    </ConceptsExample>
    <ConceptsExample
        type="Out-of-the-money"
        header="Price of ethereum stays below $3000">
        You have no interest in exercising the Call option, since you can buy the asset at a lower price in the open market.
        Premium paid: $100

        **Total Loss: $100**
