## Puts

### Selling a Put (Short Put)

When you sell a put option, you take on the obligation to buy the underlying asset from the option buyer at the strike price if they choose to exercise their right. You expose yourself to downside risk. If the price of the underlying asset decreases significantly, you still would need to purchase the asset at the strike price, even if its market value is lower.

    If the price of Ethereum remains above the strike price, the option will
    expire worthless (out of the money). You get to keep the premium received
    upfront, which becomes your profit, and not pay anything to the buyer
  </ConceptsBox>
  <ConceptsBox title="Loss" color="red">
    If the price of Ethereum drops below the strike price at the option's
    expiration, the buyer may exercise the option, resulting in a loss
    proportional to the price decrease.
