## Puts

### Buying a Put

Puts are valuable when you expect the price of the asset to decline. A good intuition to understand it is that of a bet that the price of the asset will fall. By acquiring a put option, you can protect yourself from potential losses or even potentially profit from the downward movement of the asset's price, serving as a form of insurance or a speculative tool.

    If the market price of Ethereum is below the strike price, you can exercise
    the put option. <a href='/liquidity-pools'>By exercising the option, you can buy Ethereum in the market
    at the lower price and sell it at the higher strike price.</a> The profit is
    calculated as the difference between the strike price and the market price,
    minus the premium paid for the put option.

    If the price of Ethereum remains above the strike price, the put option may
    expire worthless, resulting in a loss limited to the premium paid for the

        header="Price of Ethereum goes to $2,500" >
        - Strike Price of Put Option: $2,700
        - Premium paid: $150
